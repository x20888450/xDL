## Artifacts Size

If xDL is compiled into an independent dynamic library:

| ABI         | Compressed (KB) | Uncompressed (KB) |
| :---------- |----------------:|------------------:|
| armeabi-v7a |             7.9 |                15 |
| arm64-v8a   |             9.1 |                20 |
| x86         |             9.0 |                18 |
| x86_64      |             9.1 |                20 |


## Usage

### 1. Add dependency in build.gradle

xDL is published on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/), and uses [Prefab](https://google.github.io/prefab/) package format for [native dependencies](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/native-dependencies), which is supported by [Android Gradle Plugin 4.0+](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin?buildsystem=cmake#native-dependencies).

```Gradle
android {
    buildFeatures {
        prefab true
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.hexhacking:xdl:2.2.0'
}
```

**NOTE**:

1. Starting from version `2.0.0` of xDL, group ID changed from `io.hexhacking` to `io.github.hexhacking`.

| version range  | group ID                 | artifact ID | Repository URL |
|:---------------|:-------------------------|:------------| :--------------|
| [1.0.3, 1.2.1] | io.hexhacking            | xdl         | [repo](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/hexhacking/xdl/) |
| [2.0.0, )      | **io.github.hexhacking** | xdl         | [repo](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/github/hexhacking/xdl/) |

2. xDL uses the [prefab package schema v2](https://github.com/google/prefab/releases/tag/v2.0.0), which is configured by default since [Android Gradle Plugin 7.1.0](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin?buildsystem=cmake#7-1-0). If you are using Android Gradle Plugin earlier than 7.1.0, please add the following configuration to `gradle.properties`:

```
android.prefabVersion=2.0.0
```

### 2. Add dependency in CMakeLists.txt or Android.mk

> CMakeLists.txt

```CMake
find_package(xdl REQUIRED CONFIG)

add_library(mylib SHARED mylib.c)
target_link_libraries(mylib xdl::xdl)
```

> Android.mk

```
include $(CLEAR_VARS)
LOCAL_MODULE           := mylib
LOCAL_SRC_FILES        := mylib.c
LOCAL_SHARED_LIBRARIES += xdl
include $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY)

$(call import-module,prefab/xdl)
```

### 3. Specify one or more ABI(s) you need

```Gradle
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ndk {
            abiFilters 'armeabi-v7a', 'arm64-v8a', 'x86', 'x86_64'
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Add packaging options

If you are using xDL in an SDK project, you may need to avoid packaging libxdl.so into your AAR, so as not to encounter duplicate libxdl.so file when packaging the app project.

```Gradle
android {
    packagingOptions {
        exclude '**/libxdl.so'
    }
}
```

On the other hand, if you are using xDL in an APP project, you may need to add some options to deal with conflicts caused by duplicate libxdl.so file.

```Gradle
android {
    packagingOptions {
        pickFirst '**/libxdl.so'
    }
}
```

There is a sample app in the [xdl-sample](xdl_sample) folder you can refer to.


## API

```C
#include "xdl.h"
```

### 1. `xdl_open()` and `xdl_close()`

```C
#define XDL_DEFAULT           0x00
#define XDL_TRY_FORCE_LOAD    0x01
#define XDL_ALWAYS_FORCE_LOAD 0x02

void *xdl_open(const char *filename, int flags);
void *xdl_open2(struct dl_phdr_info *info);
void *xdl_close(void *handle);
```

They are very similar to [`dlopen()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlopen.3.html) and [`dlclose()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlclose.3.html). But `xdl_open()` can bypass the restrictions of Android 7.0+ linker namespace.

Depending on the value of the `flags` parameter, the behavior of `xdl_open()` will have some differences:

* `XDL_DEFAULT`: If the library has been loaded into memory, `xdl_open()` will not `dlopen()` it again. (But it will still return a valid `handle`)
* `XDL_TRY_FORCE_LOAD`: If the library has not been loaded into memory, `xdl_open()` will try to `dlopen()` it.
* `XDL_ALWAYS_FORCE_LOAD`: `xdl_open()` will always `dlopen()` the library.

If `xdl_open()` really uses `dlopen()` to load the library, `xdl_close()` will return the handle from linker (the return value of `dlopen()`), and then you can decide whether and when to close it with standard `dlclose()`. Otherwise, `NULL` will be returned.

`filename` can be basename or full pathname. However, Android linker has used the namespace mechanism since 7.0. If you pass basename, you need to make sure that no duplicate ELF is loaded into the current process. `xdl_open()` will only return the first matching ELF. Please consider this fragment of `/proc/self/maps` on Android 10:

```
756fc2c000-756fc7c000 r--p 00000000 fd:03 2985  /system/lib64/vndk-sp-29/libc++.so
756fc7c000-756fcee000 --xp 00050000 fd:03 2985  /system/lib64/vndk-sp-29/libc++.so
756fcee000-756fcef000 rw-p 000c2000 fd:03 2985  /system/lib64/vndk-sp-29/libc++.so

75720a0000-75720a8000 r--p 000c3000 07:38 20    /apex/com.android.conscrypt/lib64/libc++.so
760b9df000-760ba2f000 r--p 00000000 fd:03 2441  /system/lib64/libc++.so
760ba2f000-760baa1000 --xp 00050000 fd:03 2441  /system/lib64/libc++.so
760baa1000-760baa2000 rw-p 000c2000 fd:03 2441  /system/lib64/libc++.so
760baa2000-760baaa000 r--p 000c3000 fd:03 2441  /system/lib64/libc++.so
```

`xdl_open2()` creates a `handle` from `struct dl_phdr_info`. `xdl_open2()` is always `XDL_DEFAULT` semantics, i.e. it will not try to load ELF with `dlopen()`.

### 2. `xdl_sym()` and `xdl_dsym()`

```C
void *xdl_sym(void *handle, const char *symbol, size_t *symbol_size);
void *xdl_dsym(void *handle, const char *symbol, size_t *symbol_size);
```

They are very similar to [`dlsym()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlsym.3.html). They all takes a "handle" of an ELF returned by `xdl_open()` and the null-terminated symbol name, returning the address where that symbol is loaded into memory.

If the `symbol_size` parameter is not `NULL`, it will be assigned as "the bytes occupied by the content corresponding to the symbol in the ELF". If you don't need this information, just pass `NULL`.

`xdl_sym()` lookup "dynamic link symbols" in `.dynsym` as `dlsym()` does.

`xdl_dsym()` lookup "debuging symbols" in `.symtab` and "`.symtab` in `.gnu_debugdata`".

Notice:

* The symbol sets in `.dynsym` and `.symtab` do not contain each other. Some symbols only exist in `.dynsym`, and some only exist in `.symtab`. You may need to use tools such as readelf to determine which ELF section the symbol you are looking for is in.
* `xdl_dsym()` needs to load debuging symbols from disk file, and `xdl_sym()` only lookup dynamic link symbols from memory. So `xdl_dsym()` runs slower than `xdl_sym()`.
* The dynamic linker only uses symbols in `.dynsym`. The debugger actually uses the symbols in both `.dynsym` and `.symtab`.

### 3. `xdl_addr()`

```C
typedef struct
{
    const char       *dli_fname;
    void             *dli_fbase;
    const char       *dli_sname;
    void             *dli_saddr;
    size_t            dli_ssize;
    const ElfW(Phdr) *dlpi_phdr;
    size_t            dlpi_phnum;
} xdl_info_t;

#define XDL_DEFAULT 0x00
#define XDL_NON_SYM 0x01

int xdl_addr(void *addr, xdl_info_t *info, void **cache);
int xdl_addr4(void *addr, xdl_info_t *info, void **cache, int flags);
void xdl_addr_clean(void **cache);
```

`xdl_addr()` is similar to [`dladdr()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dladdr.3.html). But there are a few differences:

* `xdl_addr()` can lookup not only dynamic link symbols, but also debugging symbols. 
* `xdl_addr()` uses the `xdl_info_t` structure instead of the `Dl_info` structure, which contains more extended information: `dli_ssize` is the number of bytes occupied by the current symbol; `dlpi_phdr` points to the program headers array of the ELF where the current symbol is located; `dlpi_phnum` is the number of elements in the `dlpi_phdr` array.
* `xdl_addr()` needs to pass an additional parameter (`cache`), which will cache the ELF handle opened during the execution of `xdl_addr()`. The purpose of caching is to make subsequent executions of `xdl_addr()` of the same ELF faster. When you do not need to execute `xdl_addr()`, please use `xdl_addr_clean()` to clear the cache. For example:

```C
void *cache = NULL;
xdl_info_t info;
xdl_addr(addr_1, &info, &cache);
xdl_addr(addr_2, &info, &cache);
xdl_addr(addr_3, &info, &cache);
xdl_addr_clean(&cache);
```

* `xdl_addr4()` is similar to `xdl_addr()`, except that it adds the `flags` parameter. When the `flags` value is `XDL_DEFAULT`, the behavior of `xdl_addr4()` is the same as `xdl_addr()`. When the `flags` value is `XDL_NON_SYM`, `xdl_addr4()` will not obtain symbol-related information (the values of `dli_sname`, `dli_saddr`, and `dli_ssize` in `xdl_info_t` are all `0`).

### 4. `xdl_iterate_phdr()`

```C
#define XDL_DEFAULT       0x00
#define XDL_FULL_PATHNAME 0x01

int xdl_iterate_phdr(int (*callback)(struct dl_phdr_info *, size_t, void *), void *data, int flags);
```

`xdl_iterate_phdr()` is similar to [`dl_iterate_phdr()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dl_iterate_phdr.3.html). But `xdl_iterate_phdr()` is compatible with android 4.x on ARM32, and always including linker / linker64.

`xdl_iterate_phdr()` has an additional "flags" parameter, one or more flags can be bitwise-or'd in it:

* `XDL_DEFAULT`: Default behavior.
* `XDL_FULL_PATHNAME`: Always return full pathname instead of basename.

These flags are needed because these capabilities require additional execution time, and you don't always need them.

### 5. `xdl_info()`

```C
#define XDL_DI_DLINFO 1  // type of info: xdl_info_t

int xdl_info(void *handle, int request, void *info);
```

`xdl_info()` is similar to [`dlinfo()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlinfo.3.html). `xdl_info()` obtains information about the dynamically loaded object referred to by `handle` (obtained by an earlier call to `xdl_open`).

The only `request` parameter currently supported is `XDL_DI_DLINFO`, which means to return data of type `xdl_info_t` through the `info` parameter (note that the values of `dli_sname`, `dli_saddr`, `dli_ssize` in the returned `xdl_info_t` at this time both are `0`).

On success, `xdl_info()` returns `0`.  On failure, it returns `-1`.

## History

[xCrash 2.x](https://github.com/hexhacking/xCrash/tree/4748d183c1395c54bfb760ec6c454966d52ab73f) contains a very rudimentary module [xc_dl](https://github.com/hexhacking/xCrash/blob/4748d183c1395c54bfb760ec6c454966d52ab73f/src/native/libxcrash/jni/xc_dl.c) for searching system library symbols, which has many problems in performance and compatibility. xCrash 2.x uses it to search a few symbols from libart, libc and libc++.

Later, some other projects began to use the xc_dl module alone, including in some performance-sensitive usage scenarios. At this time, we began to realize that we need to rewrite this module, and we need a better implementation.
